See the README for frontalization code at http://www.openu.ac.il/home/hassner/projects/frontalize/ for more information.

Set up instructions:

1. Install OpenCV 2.4
2. Start MATLAB and enter the frontalization3d directory.
3. edit add_to_search_path.m to point to install directories of dependencies
4. In the face-release-1.0-basic directory, run MATLAB's mex command on all .cc
   on all .cc files, for example:

   mex fconv.cc

   I was not able to get fconvblas.cc to compile, but I was still able to run
   the demo successfully.

5. In the calib directory, recompile the calib library:

   compile_calib(<opencv-install-directory>, false)

   <opencv-install-directory> is the directory containing OpenCV's lib and
   include directories. The 2nd argument is false because we use OpenCV 2.4.

6. Run demo.m in the frontalization3d directory.
