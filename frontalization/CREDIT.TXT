This implements a face alignment method, as preprocessing to tasks such as age and gender estimation, 
and face recognition as described in [1] and [2].

The code calls an executable of facial landmarks detection, by X.Zhu and D. Ramanan, implementing the algorithm described in [3]. 

(The rest of this text is a quotation from their code: Copyright (C) 2012 Xiangxin Zhu, Deva Ramanan)

It includes pre-trained face models. 

Much of the detection code is built on top of part-based model implementation of [4]. 

The training code implements a quadratic program (QP) solver described in [5].

In the training code, we use the positive samples from MultiPIE dataset (available at www.multipie.org) and the negative images from the INRIAPerson dataset [6] (included in the package).
